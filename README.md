# Q2:Explanation:
analyzeCharacterFrequency takes an array of slogans and counts the frequency of each character for each slogan.
We use an array freq to store character counts, where each index corresponds to an ASCII character.
The first loop iterates over each slogan, and the second loop counts characters for that slogan.
